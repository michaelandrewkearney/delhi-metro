---OVERVIEW---
This application graphically models the scheduled rail traffic on the Delhi Metro
system throughout an average weekday. Use your arrow keys or the slider to change
the speed of the animation. This application also works as a fare calculator.
Click on any two stations to calculate the fare between them.

---INSTRUCTIONS---
To run the application:
  A. Run the executable JAR in the cartoon directory; or
  B. Execute the compiled App.class file
    1. Navigate to the "cartoon" directory in your command line
    2. Run "java cartoon.App"

---CONTEXT---
This is a Java application that I wrote for the Cartoon project in CS15, an
introductory computer science course, at Brown University. The requirements of
the project were to create a composite shape, animate it, and have keyboard input
control some element of the animation. Please do not share this code publicly.
    
---KNOWN BUGS---
- Running the program throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception. This is likely
  related to the the animation keyframe looping over the Array of stations too many
  times.
- An unwanted train appears at New Delhi station at the beginning of the day. This
  is likely a problem with the schedule data, which was assembled manually and which
  may not be completely clean.
- The data was collected in late 2015, and does not reflect service changes since
  then, such as service on the newly constructed ring lines.

---ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS---
Data was collected from official Delhi Metro Rail Corporation sources, including
their website and their iPhone app.
